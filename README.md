This game is a horror game that you are trapped in a hospital with many flesh eating zombie doctors. Before you find the key and escape from the hospital, you will need to collect all the vaccines inside. Your dogs (ML-Agents) will help you to find the vaccines, while you need to avoid the patrolling zombie doctors (Navmesh Agents).
